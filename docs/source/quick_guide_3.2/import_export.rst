Import or Export Projects or Libraries
===============================================

Since it is now offline mode, you must know how to export and import the project to transfer it to other devices or share it through APPs.

.. _export_project_library:

Export Projects/Libraries
----------------------------------
#. When you have created new projects and selected Save, you will see them in **My Projects**.

    .. image:: img/ez32_myproject.png

#. Your saved projects are sorted by product on the My Projects page, and you need to view them according to your product type.

    .. image:: img/ez32_picarx.png

#. In the top right corner of each project there is an export icon that allows you to export them individually.

    .. image:: img/export_icon.png

#. After clicking on it, a pop-up window will appear and you can choose to share the exported project file (``.ezbpro``) through different APPs. Or choose **Save to Files** to export the project to your device.

    .. image:: img/save_to_single.png

#. If you want to export multiple items at once, you can click the **Select** option.

    .. image:: img/click_select.png

#. Now select the projects you want to export, or use the **Select All** button.

    .. image:: img/select_all.png

#. Once you've made your selection, click the **Export** icon to share the package (``.zip``) with different APPs, or select **Save to Files** to export them to your device.

    .. image:: img/export_zip.png

#. Library exports are done in the same way, but are exported individually in ``.ezblib`` format and in multiple files in ``.zip`` format.


.. _import_project_library:

Import Projects/Libraries
----------------------------

Now let's learn how to import projects or libraries into EzBlock Studio.

#. Open the **My Projects** page, click the **Import** icon and select **Choose File**. The **Import Project** button on the home page is the same function.

    .. image:: img/import_icon.png

#. In EzBlock Studio, you can only import ``.ezbpro``, ``.ezblib`` and batch exported ``.zip`` format files from EzBlock Studio. Other files cannot be imported.

    .. image:: img/import_file.png

#. If the project or library you are importing has the same contents as the project in EzBlock Studio, there will be a pop-up window reminding you to **Keep both**, **Skip** or **Replace**.

    .. image:: img/import_same.png

#. Then they will be imported into different product categories depending on your files.
