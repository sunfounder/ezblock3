Quick User Guide for EzBlock 3.0
=====================================


Compared with the Bluetooth communication of EzBlock 2, EzBlock 3 uses Websocket to communicate, which is much faster.

To make it faster and easier to use, we have optimized the connection and usage process so that you can learn programming quickly with Ezblock Studio.

.. note::
    EzBlock has been updated to version 3.1, it is recommended to update to the new version, for a detailed tutorial please refer to: :ref:`quick_guide_latest`.


The following steps must be followed before you can use EzBlock: install the EzBlock image to your SD card, install the EzBlock app to your mobile device, and then refer to :ref:`connect_product_ezblock_3.0` for pre-use configuration, and finally you can open the examples directly to run them.
