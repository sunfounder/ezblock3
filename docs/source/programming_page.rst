.. list-table:: Widget of Remote Control

    * - **Widget**
      - **Description**
    * - Joystick
      - The white dot is centered, and both X and Y values are 0. Drag the white point to the right to increase the X value; drag it upwards to increase the Y value. The ranges of X and Y are both (-100, 100).
    * - Slider
      - When the white point is on the far left, the value is 0. Drag the white point to the right to increase the value. The range is (0, 100).
    * - D-Pad
      - This is a control composed of 4 Buttons, each button is independent of each other. The value of the Button is 1 when it is pressed and 0 when it is released.
    * - Button
      - The value is 1 when pressed and 0 when released.
    * - Switch
      - When ON, the value is 1; when OFF, the value is 0.
    * - Video
      - Please check :ref:`video_latest`
    * - Digital Tube
      - It can display NUMBER (such as 123.3) or TIME (such as 11:55) like a real four-digit digital tube.
    * - Pie Chart
      - It is used to indicate the proportion of the part and the whole in the data series. Each set of data should include a ``name`` and ``value``.
    * - Bar Chart
      - The data of multiple objects can be displayed intuitively for comparative analysis. Each object should include a ``name`` and ``value``.
    * - Line Chart
      - Continuous data of multiple objects can be displayed. Each object should include a ``name`` and ``value``. Continuous data generation is based on multiple calls (usually, using loops).
    * - Bulb
      - Like the actual LED, it lights up when 1 is written, and turns off when 0 is written.
