Quick User Guide for EzBlock(3.1)
=====================================


The main optimization of EzBlock 3.1 is the compatibility with the built-in Bluetooth of the Raspberry Pi, no need to use an expansion board with Bluetooth module. 

.. note::
    The old version of the robot can also be used normally after burning the new image. The bluetooth module on the original robot hat will not conflict with the new system.

The following steps must be followed before you can use EzBlock: install the EzBlock image to your SD card, install the EzBlock app to your mobile device, and then refer to :ref:`connect_product_ezblock_3.1` for pre-use configuration, and finally you can open the examples directly to run them.
